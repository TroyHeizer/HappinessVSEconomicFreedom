Project Statement
This project aims to compare the happiness levels of countries with their overall economic freedom. By analyzing two datasets — the Economic Freedom Index and the World Happiness Index from Kaggle — the goal is to uncover correlations and insights to understand if and how economic freedom influences the happiness of a nation’s citizens.

Required Features List
1. Read Two Data Files (CSV):
    * Load and read the datasets from CSV files.
2. Clean and Merge Data:
    * Clean the datasets and perform a pandas merge to combine the two datasets.
    * Calculate additional values based on the merged dataset.
3. Create Visualizations:
    * Produce at least three visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, or another plotting library to display the data.
4. Build a Custom Data Dictionary:
    * Create a data dictionary if the datasets do not already include one. Include it in the README or as a separate document.
5. Annotate Your Code:
    * Ensure all Python scripts are well-commented and the README.md is clear and informative.

Visualization Figures

Figure 1 shows the top 35 Happiest Countries
Figure 2 shows the least happy 35 countries
Figure 3 shows which countries are happiest by region
Figure 4 shows which economic freedoms have the most impact on happiness
Figure 5 show the correlation between happiness and property rights for the top 35 happiest countries

Setup Instructions

Clone repo to your local machien

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
You can install them using pip:

“pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn”

File Structure
* load_data.py: Contains functions for loading and cleaning datasets.
* visualizations.py: Contains functions for generating visualizations.
* merged_dataset.csv: The cleaned and merged dataset used for analysis.

Running the Project

1. Load and Prepare Data:
    * Run load_data.py to load and clean the datasets. This script will generate merged_dataset.csv which is required for the visualizations.
    * Execute the script from the command line:shCopy codepython load_data.py
2. Generate Visualizations:
    * To create and view the visualizations, run the visualizations.py script. This script will generate various charts and plots based on the merged_dataset.csv.
    * Execute the script from the command line:“python visualizations.py”
3. Viewing the Results:
    * The visualizations will appear in separate windows. Ensure your environment supports graphical output to view these plots.

Troubleshooting
* Import Errors:
    * Check for circular imports and ensure your import statements in visualizations.py are correctly defined. Avoid importing modules from visualizations.py within visualizations.py itself.
* Missing Data:
    * Ensure merged_dataset.csv is present in the correct directory and is properly formatted. This file should be generated by running load_data.py.
Notes
* Ensure all CSV files are correctly placed in the project directory.
* Adjust file paths in the code if running scripts from a different directory.

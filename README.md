Project Statement
This project aims to compare the happiness levels of countries with their overall economic freedom. By analyzing two datasets — the Economic Freedom Index and the World Happiness Index from Kaggle — the goal is to uncover correlations and insights to understand if and how economic freedom influences the happiness of a nation’s citizens.

Required Features List
1. Read Two Data Files (CSV):
    * Load and read the datasets from CSV files.
2. Clean and Merge Data:
    * Clean the datasets and perform a pandas merge to combine the two datasets.
    * Calculate additional values based on the merged dataset.
3. Create Visualizations:
    * Produce at least three visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, or another plotting library to display the data.
4. Build a Custom Data Dictionary:
    * Create a data dictionary if the datasets do not already include one. Include it in the README or as a separate document.
5. Annotate Your Code:
    * Ensure all Python scripts are well-commented and the README.md is clear and informative.

Setup Instructions

Clone repo to your local machien

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
You can install them using pip:

“pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn”

Running the Project

1.Run main.py to execute the data cleaning, merging, and visualizations.
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:

"python main.py"

2 Viewing the Results:
    * The visualizations will appear in separate windows. Ensure your environment supports graphical output to view these plots.

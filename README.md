Project Statement

This project aims to compare the happiness levels of countries with their overall economic freedom. By analyzing two datasets (the Economic Freedom Index and the World Happiness Index from Kaggle) I seek to uncover correlations and insights that may be of interest. The goal is to understand if and how economic freedom influences the happiness of a nation’s citizens.

Features List

1. Read TWO data files (CSV)

2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set. 

3. Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.

4. Build a custom data dictionary and include it either in your README or as a separate document. This will only apply if your data set does not already have a data dictionary or if you’re building a custom data set. For an example, see the resources to the right.

5. Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md
